    <h1>Tiffany Duong</h1>
    <p>Hi, there! I am a product manager and marketer focused on creating and disseminating delightful user experiences for startups.
      My background in human-centered design combined with my interest in technology and engineering brought me to working in product,
      and my passion for moving quickly and innovating has led me to consulting startups.
    </p>
    <p>Most recently, I worked on AI/ML products at <a class="work" href="https://www.alteryx.com/">Alteryx</a>,
      an enterprise SaaS data analytics company. There, I honed in on what it really takes to make an LLM accessible to an everyday user.
      Beyond that, I have also worked on building out cloud services at the <a class="work" href="https://cloud.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a>
      as a 2020 Civic Digital Fellow as well as software development and product at Series B health tech company, <a class="work" href="https://www.wellinks.com/">Wellinks</a>. 
      Always interested in ways to make a positive social impact using technology.
    </p>
